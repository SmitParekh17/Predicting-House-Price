Approach:

1) Importing Packages.

2) Loading Data.

3) Outlier checked and Removed in GrLivArea by checking using seaborn's regplot.

4) Separating predictor and target

5) Checking for missing values by plotting bar chart

6) Handling missing values as per the data description
	i) Filling missing values for few features as 'None'
	ii) Filling missing value for LotFront feature based on neighbourhood column
	iii) Filling missing values for few features with 0. 
	iv) Filling columns with small amount of missing values with Imputer 
	v) Dropping columns with no variation in values

7) Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
	i) Checking correlation with target variable and selecting features having correlation 0.4 
	   and above for feature engineering
	ii) Adding polynomial features and also reciprocol features for non linear relationship between independent and dependent variable.
	iii) -> Bivariate Analysis of categorical columns
     	     -> Encoding based on variation of each independent variable with dependent variable
     	     -> Clustering values in features
	iv)  -> Bivariate Analysis of numerical columns
    	     -> Binning few features based on variation
    	     -> Creating flags for few features

8) Treating skewness 

9) Checking distribution of target variable

10) Applying base model with cross validation
	i) Linear Regression
	ii) Decision Tree
	iii) Random Forest
	iv) ElasticNet
	v) Lasso
	vi) Ridge
	vii) XGBoost

11) Optimizing good performing models using Grid Search (Too much time to get executed)

12) Feature selection using SelectFromModel

13) Applying StackingRegressor and xgb as meta-regressor
